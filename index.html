Last Updated: [3/15/2025]

1. Introduction
Welcome to Breaking Point. Your privacy is important to us, and we are committed to protecting your data. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data within the game and your rights regarding data collection and advertising preferences.

2. No Data Collection

Your real name, address, email, or phone number.
Your precise location or any other personally identifiable information.
Any payment details, banking information, or financial data.
Any form of biometric or health-related data.
All game-related progress, settings, and preferences are stored locally on your device. We do not upload, sync, or back up any of your game data to our servers. You are solely responsible for maintaining and backing up your progress. If you lose access to your device, uninstall the game, or experience data corruption, we are not responsible for restoring any lost progress.

3. Third-Party Advertising & Data Collection
Breaking Point uses third-party advertising services, including but not limited to Unity Ads, to display advertisements within the game. These third-party services may collect certain data to provide personalized ads based on your interests.

We do not directly collect or process this data. Instead, third-party advertisers handle data collection in compliance with their own privacy policies and applicable laws (such as GDPR, CCPA, PIPL, LGPD, and others).

Important Notice: The option to disable data collection is not available worldwide. It is only offered in regions where privacy laws require such an option, including but not limited to:

GDPR (European Union)
CCPA (California, USA)
PIPL (China)
LGPD (Brazil)
Other similar regulations
If you are outside these regions, certain data collection may continue in accordance with the policies of third-party ad providers.

If you do not wish to receive personalized ads, you can disable targeted advertising from the in-game settings. However, you will still receive non-personalized ads that may be less relevant to you.

4. No Cloud Saves or Online Account Storage
Breaking Point does not use cloud-based storage, online accounts, or any form of server-side saving. All of your game progress is stored locally on your device. If you:

Delete or uninstall the game,
Reset your device,
Experience technical issues that result in data loss,
we are not responsible for any lost progress, in-game items, or currency. There is no way to recover lost data once it is erased from your device.

5. Player Consent & Access to the Game
Upon launching the game for the first time, you will be required to accept this Privacy Policy before proceeding. If you decline, you will not be able to access or play Breaking Point. This ensures transparency and compliance with relevant privacy regulations.

We are not responsible for any progress loss due to device issues, software bugs, or accidental deletions.
